General product description:
----------------------------

Anti-keylogger for Microsoft Windows 2000/XP provides every computer 
with strong protection against all types of keylogging programs 
(software keyloggers), both known and unknown, currently in use or 
being developed at the present moment.

Anti-keylogger is capable to buck various types of keylogging programs
possibly included in any commercial, shareware, freeware products, as
well as in Trojan horses, viruses of very different operation
principles. Due to the Anti-keylogger's protection spy software will
not be able to record and steal your sensitive information, passwords,
logins, PIN (Personal Identification Number) etc.

Since Anti-keylogger does not use any signature bases, it can protect
against even unknown software keyloggers!

Anti-keylogger works transparently for the user and silently, asking
the user no questions thus excluding the probability of an error when
making a decision.

distinguish it from other anti-spy products:

 - No signature base
 - Full UNICODE support
 - Multiprocessor & hypherthreading architectures support
 - Windows 2000/XP support

The anti-keylogging protection starts instantly at the moment of the
operating system loading and before the user logs in the system; it
automatically deactivates all the running keylogging programs.
