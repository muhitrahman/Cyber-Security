 1. Overview 
-------------
   This program is intended to recover lost passwords for RAR/WinRAR archives
 of versions 2.xx and 3.xx. The program finds by the method of exhaustive
 search all possible combinations of characters ("bruteforce" method), or
 using passwords from lists ("wordlist" or "dictionary" method).
 Self-extracting archives and multivolume archives are supported. The program
 is able to save a current state (you can interrupt the program at any time,
 and restart from the same state later). Estimated time calculator allows you
 to configure the program more carefully.


 2. System requirements
------------------------
   RAR Password Cracker requires Windows 9x/ME/NT4/2000/XP. There are no
 special requirements for memory capacity, but the processor performance
 should be as high as possible. Special hardware is not required.


 3. Install/Uninstall
----------------------
Install:
   Unzip the downloaded file called rpc412.zip into a temporary folder and
 run the rpc412_setup.exe file. The installer will let you choose where to
 install the program and create a program group in the Window's Start Menu.

Uninstall:
   Unstalling of RAR Password Cracker may be carried out either by choosing
 "Add/Delete Program" in Control Panel or by choosing "Uninstall" from the
 program group.


 4. Notes on use
-----------------
   1) When adding files into a project, choose the most preferable file marked
 by the program. The only exclusion from this rule is files which have a known
 fragment (for Stored files only).
   2) It is not necessary to add several files from the same archive if you
 are sure they have the same password.
   3) More than one files in a project don't slow a cracking process.
   4) Dictionary files. Here you can find some of them:
       http://www.sparkleware.com/lists.html
       http://wordlists.security-on.net/
       http://www.accessdata.com/dictionaries.htm
 For more dictionaries use search engines, ask peoples in newsgroups,
 webforums, etc.
   5) Period of autosaving - 2 min.
   6) Don't worry about system resources - the program uses only free
 processor time and doesn't slow other applications.


 5. How to register
--------------------
   RAR Password Cracker 4.xx is shareware. You may use and evaluate it free
 of charge and without time limit. However, if you wish to use the software
 without limitations of free evaluation version, you must purchase the license.
   There are two different licenses: fully functional version and low-cost
 time-limited fully functional version. Both licenses grant you rights to use
 fully functional version of RAR Password Cracker on up to 3 computers at a
 time. If more computers are involved into password recovery process, you must
 purchase more than one licenses. For prices and additional information please
 visit http://www.RARPasswordCracker.com/reg.html
   If you can't pay but need to recover RAR 2.00-2.80 password, do use
 RAR Password Cracker 3.13. It is a freeware but requires some computer
 knowledge and experience. Don't try to use cracks, serials and so on at all.
 The integrity validation routines are built into the password recovery
 routines, so any crack's code or unauthorized serial may cause the password
 recovery system to work incorrectly. You even will never know whether it has
 occured or not!
   The registered version allows you to:
   - crack more than 2 RAR files at once.
   - use more than 2 dictionary files at once.
   - find passwords which have a dynamic part longer than 3 characters in
     length.
 Also registered users receive free technical support!
